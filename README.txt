# Beginner's good practices

This is assuming you code with the latest ECMAScript spec (ES2018 as of now).

## General advice
1. Assume you don't know best.
1. [Devdocs](<https://devdocs.io/>) is your best friend.
1. Use [ESLint](<https://eslint.org/>).
1. Support older browsers? Combine [Babel](<https://babeljs.io/>) and [Browserslist](<https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist>)
    - Use `.babelrc` and `.browserslistrc` config files.
1. [`"use strict";`](<https://eslint.org/docs/rules/strict>) at the top of every file that is not an [ES6 module](<http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html>).

Each good practice ought to be in its own `.md` file.  
A link to the related ESLint rule(s) will be included if it exists.

## Resources
### Everyone
- [Devdocs](<https://devdocs.io/>) still your friend. **Bookmark it**, [install it](<https://devdocs.egoist.moe/>)

### Beginners
- [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](<https://javascript.info/>)
- [Eloquent Javascript (online)](<https://eloquentjavascript.net/>); paperback comes ~~November~~ December this year, be patient!
- **Only if you have a really good programming knowledge background** [JavaScript for impatient programmers](<http://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/index.html>)

### Intermediate
Work in progress (WIP)
- If you have ES5.1 knowledge and want to be up-to-date [Exploring ES6](<http://exploringjs.com/es6.html>) + [Exploring ES2016 and 2017](<http://exploringjs.com/es2016-es2017.html>) + [Exploring ES2018 and ES2019](<http://exploringjs.com/es2018-es2019/index.html>)
- [Dr. Axel Rauschmayer blog](<http://2ality.com/>)

### Advanced
Work in progress (WIP)
- [JavaScript. The Core (**2nd edition**)](<http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/>)
- [You don't know JS](<https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/>)  
"but wait I heard it's a good book for beginners?" Only if you know what is in ES6+ and what is not, so that you can discard outdated content and advice. That's why I put it in advanced.

### Expert
Work in progress (WIP)







scope variable var, let, const

let, const are block scope


const a = () => {
    const word = "hello";
    b();
}
const b = () => {
    console.log("word");
}
a();

There's no problem with what you've done, but you must remember the difference between function declarations and function expressions.

A function declaration, that is:

function doSomething () {}
Is hoisted entirely to the top of the scope (and like let and const they are block scoped as well).

This means that the following will work:

doSomething() // works!
function doSomething() {}
A function expression, that is:

[const | let | var] = function () {} (or () =>
Is the creation of an anonymous function (function () {}) and the creation of a variable, and then the assignment of that anonymous function to that variable.

So the usual rules around variable hoisting within a scope -- block-scoped variables (let and const) do not hoist as undefined to the top of their block scope.

This means:

if (true) {
    doSomething() // will fail
    const doSomething = function () {}
}
Will fail since doSomething is not defined. (It will throw a  ReferenceError)

If you switch to using var you get your hoisting of the variable, but it will be initialized to undefined so that block of code above will still not work. (This will throw a TypeError since doSomething is not a function at the time you call it)

As far as standard practices go, you should always use the proper tool for the job.

Axel Rauschmayer has a great post on scope and hoisting including es6 semantics: Variables and Scoping in ES6
